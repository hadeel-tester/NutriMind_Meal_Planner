Sprint: AI Agents

Building with AI Agents

Overview

This is the project for Sprint 3, where you design and build an AI agent of your own choosing. Drawing on everything from the sprint (agent architectures, state management, LangGraph, long-term memory, and human-in-the-loop patterns), you will create an agent that solves a real problem. This is the most open-ended project in the course so far: you choose the domain, the tools, and the architecture.



Topics:



AI Agents

Streamlit or Next.js

Agents: LangGraph/LangChain

Long-Term/Short-Term Memory

OpenAI API

Prompt Engineering

Prerequisites:



Python / TypeScript knowledge

Knowledge of ChatGPT and OpenAI API

Basic knowledge of Streamlit / Next.js

Knowledge of agents and how they work

Familiarity with function calling

Understanding of LangGraph/LangChain

Estimated time to complete: 18 hours

You will now build an app with an AI Agent of your choice on the backend. This is your opportunity to be creative and build something that interests you. Your agent should be useful and solve a real problem. Think about what kind of agent would be valuable to users and implement it.

Remember, these are just starting points! The best agents often come from identifying a specific problem you or others face and creating a solution for it. Think about:



What problems do you encounter in your daily life?

What tasks do you wish could be automated?

What would make your work or studies easier?

What would help others in your field or community?

The intended code editor for this project is VS Code.



If you feel confident, feel free to over-engineer the app by adding different things from the optional tasks and coming up with your own things. You can try making it as a portfolio project!



Remember, you have all the tools at your disposal: ChatGPT, StackOverflow, or a friend!



Task requirements

The exact task requirements are as follows:



Agent Purpose:



Define a clear purpose for your agent

Explain why this agent is useful

Identify the target users

Core Functionality:



Implement the main features that make your agent useful

Ensure the agent can perform its primary tasks effectively

Include necessary user interactions

User Interface:



Build a user-friendly interface for all functionalities

Make the interface intuitive and easy to use

Technical Implementation:



Use appropriate tools and libraries

Implement proper error handling

Ensure the agent can handle real-world usage

Documentation:



Provide clear documentation on how to use your agent

Include examples of common use cases

Explain any technical decisions made

Optional tasks

After the main functionality is implemented and your code works correctly, and you feel that you want to upgrade your project, choose various improvements from this list. The list is sorted by difficulty levels.



Caution: Some of the tasks in medium or hard categories may contain tasks with concepts or libraries that may be introduced in later sections or even require outside knowledge/time to research outside of the course.



Easy

Ask ChatGPT to critique your solution from the usability, security, and prompt-engineering sides.

Give the agent a personality: tweak responses to make them more formal, friendly, or concise based on user needs.

Provide the user with the ability to choose from a list of LLMs (Gemini, OpenAI, etc.) for this project.

Add all of the OpenAI settings (temperature, top-p frequency) for the user to tune as sliders/fields.

Add an interactive help feature or chatbot guide.

Medium

Calculate and display token usage and costs.

Add retry logic for agents.

Implement long-term or short-term memory in LangChain/LangGraph.

Implement one more function tool that would call an external API.

Add user authentication and personalisation.

Implement a caching mechanism to store and retrieve frequently used responses.

Implement a feedback loop where users can rate the responses, and use this feedback to improve the agent's performance.

Implement 2 extra function tools (5 in total). Have a UI for the user to either enable or disable these function tools. Develop a plugin system that allows users to add or remove functionalities from the chatbot dynamically.

Implement multi-model support (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).

Hard

Agentic RAG: Think of a way to add RAG functionality to the LangChain/LangGraph application and implement it.



Add one of these LLM observability tools: Arize Phoenix, LangSmith, Lunary, or others.



Fine-tune the model for your specific domain.



Create an agent that can learn from user feedback. This agent should be able to adjust its capabilities based on the feedback to improve future performance.



Implement an agent that can integrate with external data sources to enrich its knowledge. This could involve fetching additional data from APIs or websites.



Implement an agent that can collaborate with other agents in a distributed system. This agent should be able to work with agents running on different machines or in different environments, coordinating their efforts to solve the problem efficiently.



Deploy your app to the cloud with proper scaling.



Evaluation criteria

Problem definition

The learner has a well-defined problem that they are aiming to solve with this project.

The learner can articulate how the app they’re building addresses the problem they identified.

Understanding core concepts

The learner understands the basic principles of how agents work.

The learner can mention differences between different agent types.

The learner can explain function calling implementation clearly.

The learner demonstrates good code organisation practices.

The learner can identify potential error scenarios and edge cases.

Technical implementation

The learner knows how to use a front-end library using their knowledge and/or external resources.

The learner has created a relevant knowledge base for their domain if applicable.

The learner has implemented appropriate security considerations.

Reflection and improvement

The learner understands the potential problems with the application.

The learner can offer suggestions on improving the code and the project.

The learner understands when to use prompt engineering, RAG, or agents.

Bonus points

For maximum points, the learner should implement at least 2 medium and 1 hard optional tasks.

Creating the web app

There are a number of ways we can choose to develop our application; here's some information about a few frameworks we recommend:



Python track: Streamlit

Python track: Gradio

Streamlit vs Gradio comparison

JavaScript track: Next.js

Approach to solving the task

1-5 hours of attempting to solve the task using your own knowledge + ChatGPT. It is encouraged to use ChatGPT both for:

Understanding this task better

Writing the code

Improving the code

Understanding the code

If you feel that some knowledge is missing, please revisit the parts in the previous sprints and check out additional resources.

Feel free to revisit the various Google Colab notebooks in Sprint 3. They can help you to understand agents better.

If during the first 1-2 hours you see you are making no progress and that the task seems much too hard for you, we recommend 10 more hours working on the problem with help from peers and JTLs.

Out of these 10 hours, you are expected to spend about half of them working with someone else, whether that is peer study buddies, peers who have completed the exercise and want to help you, or JTLs in open sessions.

If you still can't solve it, check the suggested solution and spend as much time as needed (also based on what you have available until the next deadline) to understand it.
